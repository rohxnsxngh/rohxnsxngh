I am a driven and ambitious student with a strong background in engineering and design. I will graduate from Texas A&M university in fall of 2023 with a B.S. in Honors Mechanical Engineering and a minor in Computer Science. A few of my favorite aspects of engineering include computer-aided design, software development, and engineering collaboration.
